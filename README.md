**This is Me.** 🙋‍♀️

## 👩‍💻 About me

I build and maintain **design systems** that scale across teams and products — making **consistency easy** and **change manageable**.

I believe in **strong foundations** 🧱: systems that support **velocity** ⚡, hold up over time, and remain **easy to understand as they grow**. I care deeply about **clarity**, **maintainability**, and **reducing complexity** in large codebases.

I genuinely enjoy cleaning up **technical debt** 🧹 — it’s one of the fastest ways to improve the health of a system. I also use **AI-powered codemods** 🤖 to run audits, identify **drift**, and keep systems **aligned** with their original intent.

## 🎯 Current areas of focus

### 🎨 Design systems

- **Atomic Design** and **component-driven architecture**
- **Design tokens** as a **single source of truth**
- Bridging **design intent** and **production code**
- Tooling and documentation that support **adoption at scale**

### 🧩 Legacy code

- Removing **deprecated** and **dead code**
- Simplifying **overgrown abstractions**
- Improving structure **without changing behaviour**

## 🐶 Head of oversight

**This is Minnie.** 🐾

She helps keep me **accountable**, supports my **focus**, and reminds me when it’s time to **take a break** ☕.

Outside of work, I’m training her to be a **support dog** 🦮. She brings out the best in me — **we come as a package** 💛.
