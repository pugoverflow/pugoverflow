# 👋 Hi, I’m Amanda

## 👩‍💻 About me

I build and maintain **design systems** that scale across teams and products, making **consistency straightforward** and **change manageable**.

I believe in **strong foundations** 🧱: systems that support **velocity** ⚡, stand up over time, and stay easy to understand as they grow. I care about **clarity**, **maintainability**, and **reducing complexity** in large codebases.

I enjoy cleaning up **technical debt** 🧹 — it’s one of the most effective ways to improve a system. I also use **AI-powered codemods** 🤖 to run **audits**, identify **drift**, and keep systems **aligned**.

## 🎯 Current Areas of Focus

### 🎨 Design systems
- **Atomic Design** and **component-driven architecture**  
- **Design tokens** as a **single source of truth**  
- Bridging **design intent** and **production code**  
- Tooling and documentation that support **adoption at scale**  

### 🧩 Legacy code
- Removing **deprecated** and **dead code**  
- Simplifying **overgrown abstractions**  
- Improving structure **without changing behaviour**

**This is Minnie.** 🐾

She helps keep me **accountable**, supports my **focus**, and reminds me when it’s time to **take a break** ☕.

Outside of work, I’m training her to be a **support dog** 🦮. She brings out the best in me — **we come as a package** 💛.
